- WWW2018 Detect Rumor and Stance Jointly by Neural Multi-task Learning 
  - [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3184558.3188729)
  - determining the stances on the posts in question can be pertinent to the successful detection of rumors, and vice versa.
  - propose a joint framework that unifies the two highly pertinent tasks, i.e., rumor detection and stance classification.
  - dataset: rumor detection-Twitter (Liu et al.)  stance classification-PHEME and FNC
  
- CIKM2018 Rumor Detection with Hierarchical Social Attention Network
  - [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3269206.3271709)
  - we detect rumors by leveraging hierarchical representations at different levels and the social contexts.
  - we propose a novel hierarchical neural network combined with social information (word-level, post-level, subevent-level)
  - dataset: Twitter  and  Weibo  (Ma et al.)

  - [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32236-6_30)
  - Usually, the events on social media are divided into several time segments, and for each segment, corresponding text will be converted as vectors for various neural network models to detect rumors. During this process, however, only sentence-level embedding has been considered, while the contextual information at the word level has been largely ignored.
  -  we propose a novel rumor detection method based on a hierarchical recurrent convolutional neural network, which integrates contextual information for rumor detection.
  - dataset: Twitter  and  Weibo  (Ma et al.)
